You have been studying Kotlin for a few weeks and now it is time to receive feedback and grades for the work you have done so far.

## What is the Student Success Week?
The *Student Success Week* is all about you, the student. 

During this week there will be no lecture and thus no new module will be covered. Instead, it is a week in which the instructor will provide you with feedback and grades for the progress you have done thus far.

## What are you required to do during Student Success Week #1?
You are required to book a 1-on-1 meeting with the instructor. He will soon provide the booking link.

During the meeting, you are going to receive grades and feedback for your class performance for **Modules 101 to 104**. Likewise, you will also have the opportunity to share your thoughts, concerns, and comments about the course with the instructor.

**It is imperative that you complete homework assignments for Modules 101 to 104 before meeting the instructor.**
